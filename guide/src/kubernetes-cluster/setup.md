# Kubernetes Cluster Setup

Before we setup the Kubernetes Goat, we need to have working Kubernetes cluster admin access.

There are many ways you can run the Kubernetes Cluster. Some of them includes running in

* Cloud provider Kubernetes service (like GKE, EKS, AKS, DO, etc.)
* Locally provisioned cluster
* Minikube environnement
* Katacoda Playground

Refer to the Kubernetes setup documentation for more information and details at [https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/)
